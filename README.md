# FlexChipSet

This is personal project I have been working on lately, from scratch. If you know me, you should know I like to work from scratch.

The purpose of this project is to make a modular chipset. This would allow for motherboards that could swap their RAM slots with RAM from the next generation without starting over completely. This serves to create much less E-Waste and will make newer, technology more accessable to those without the ability to refresh their machines too often.
